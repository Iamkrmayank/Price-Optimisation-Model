A Price Optimization Model is a strategic approach that businesses use to determine the optimal price for their products or services in order to maximize profitability. 
The goal is to find the right balance between setting prices high enough to cover costs and generate profit while remaining competitive and attractive to customers. 
Price optimization involves analyzing various factors, such as market conditions, customer behavior, competitor pricing, and internal costs.
